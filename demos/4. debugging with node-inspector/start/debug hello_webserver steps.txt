REM get node-inspector module
npm install node-inspector
REM sadly npm exits the shell so we can't run this as a batch file

REM start the process we'll debug:
node --debug "..\..\2. hello web server\start\app.js"

REM start a new shell and continue:
REM start node inspector
node_modules\.bin\node-inspector

REM start your browser at the debug url
start http://localhost:8080/debug?port=5858
REM this port is not the port of the node web server
REM this is the port of the node debugger

REM now set some breakpoints

REM start the website (run the node process) so it'll hit the breakpoints
start http://localhost:8001/
